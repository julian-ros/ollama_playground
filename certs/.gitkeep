# This directory is for corporate CA certificates
# 
# For corporate environments:
#   Place your corporate CA certificate as 'my_corporate_ca.crt' in this directory
#
# For standalone environments:
#   Create an empty file named 'my_corporate_ca.crt' in this directory:
#   touch certs/my_corporate_ca.crt
#
# This ensures the Docker COPY command always succeeds regardless of environment.
